Task CRUD Documentation in Lua
This document describes the functionality of the Lua script for task management, including the available functions, the data structure used, and the libraries involved.

1. Introduction
The script implements a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage a task list. Tasks are stored in memory in a Lua table. User interaction occurs via the terminal, with a menu of options to perform the available operations.

2. Data Structure
Tasks are stored in a Lua table called tasks. Each element of the table represents a task and is a table with the following fields:

description: A string containing the task description.
completed: A boolean value (true or false) indicating whether the task is completed.
Example: tasks = {
  { description = "Buy milk", completed = false },
  { description = "Pay bills", completed = true },
}

3. Functions
The script defines the following functions:

create_task(description): Adds a new task to the tasks table.
list_tasks(): Returns a string with the list of tasks, numbering each item and indicating the status (completed or not).
complete_task(number): Marks the specified task as completed.
remove_task(number): Removes the specified task from the tasks table.
display_menu(): Displays the menu of options for the user.
4. Libraries Used
The script uses the following standard Lua libraries/functions:

table: For table manipulation, including table.insert (to add elements) and table.remove (to remove elements).
io: For input/output, including io.read (to read user input) and print (to print messages to the terminal).
string: For string manipulation, such as formatting the output.
tonumber: To convert strings to numbers, used to validate user input.
Relational and logical operators: Used to control the program flow (e.g., if, elseif, else, and, or, not).
5. Execution Flow
The script enters an infinite loop (while true) that displays the menu of options and waits for user input. Based on the chosen option, the corresponding function is called. The loop continues until the user chooses the "Exit" option (5).

6. Usage Example
Save the code in a file named crud.lua.
Run the script in the terminal with the command lua crud.lua.
Follow the instructions in the menu to create, list, complete, or remove tasks.
7. Final Considerations
This script is a basic example of CRUD in Lua. It can be expanded to include features such as data persistence (in files or databases), more robust input validation, more comprehensive error handling, and a more sophisticated user interface.
